# basic-quant-trading
This repo contains some basic elements of quantitative trading from my notes of some textbooks:
  1. Python usage
  2. Statistics
  3. Trading Strategies
  4. Data

Remark: Some files, like "candle.py" and "movingAverage.py", are directly imported from outside for more convinient usage.
